The data is read in from the food.xml file in the XMLFood file, this contains all the foods with attributes such as their name, a short description for the subtitle,
a long description, the ingredients needed and the steps to complete the recipe and the url for the website.
The first page is controlled by MainActivity and the layout is in activity_main.xml and displays a title and a grid recyler view of the foods.
When you click on a food, it brings you to the food activity page which shows the ingredients needed for the recipe.
This is controlled by FoodActivity and the layout is in activity_food.xml
You can now click on one of two buttons, one to bring you home to the main page, one to continue you forward to the recipe page.
All data involving the food is passed through intents to the next activity.
Once at the recipe page, this is controlled by DetailsActivity and the layout is in activity_details.xml
Then you can go back to the food activity page or continue to the web view with the two buttons.
The web view page is controlled by WebActivity and the layout is in activity_web. It displays the url of the food from the xml file
